# Gala Groceries
This repository contains the code and documentation for the Gala Groceries project, which focuses on addressing supply chain issues in the grocery industry using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The project aims to optimize stock levels of perishable items to minimize waste and maximize customer satisfaction.

# Problem Statement
Gala Groceries, a technology-led grocery store chain, faces the challenge of balancing stock levels to avoid overstocking and understocking perishable items. The goal is to improve stock management by accurately predicting stock levels based on sales data and sensor data on an hourly basis. This will enable Gala Groceries to make informed procurement decisions and optimize their supply chain.

# Project Phases
The project is divided into several phases, each focusing on specific tasks and deliverables. Here's an overview of the project phases:

* Phase 1: Data Exploration and Analysis
In this phase, we analyze the provided dataset to gain insights and understand the statistical properties of the data. The notebooks "eda.ipynb" and "eda_walkthrough.ipynb" provided in the repository guide the data exploration process. We examine the distributions of columns, calculate descriptive statistics, and perform rigorous data analysis to familiarize ourselves with the dataset.

* Phase 2: Data Modeling and Strategic Planning
In this phase, we review the data model diagram and identify the relevant data sources for modeling the problem statement. We decide which data to use from the available sensor data and formulate a strategic plan to utilize this data effectively. The goal is to outline how we will use the data to accurately predict stock levels and provide actionable insights to Gala Groceries.

* Phase 3: Communication and Presentation
In this phase, we summarize our findings and strategic plan in a concise and business-friendly manner. We draft an email to the Data Science team leader, summarizing our analysis, recommendations, and any additional data requirements to fulfill the client's business problem. Additionally, we create a PowerPoint slide summarizing the data choices, plan of action, and key insights. This slide will be shared with the Data Science team leader and the client for review.

* Phase 4: Machine Learning Deployment and Evaluation
In this phase, we prepare a Python module that contains the code to train the machine learning model and output performance metrics. The module will be used to deploy the algorithm into production. The ML engineering team integrates the module with Gala Groceries' live system and collects predictions for evaluation against actual results. The ML engineering team collaborates with us to discuss the algorithm's performance and identify areas for improvement.
